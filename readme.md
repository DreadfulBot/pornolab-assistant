At the current moment, plugin can:

* Expand all spoilers in topic
* Open all links to the full screenshots in topic
* Add preview modal: it appears when you focus links, that contains 'pornolab.net'. In modal displays some information, such as poster (first image in a topic), title and so on. Maybe in a future I will add something more
