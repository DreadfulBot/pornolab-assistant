# Image Column

Currently, the plugin can:

* Expand all spoilers in a topic
* Open all links to the full screenshots in a topic
* Add a preview modal: it appears when you focus on links that contain 'pornolab.net'. The modal displays information such as the poster (first image in a topic), title, and more. Maybe in the future I will add something else
* Add a preview column with the first large image

## Advantages

* *Use it only when you need it!*: There are no hidden background activities that cause performance degradation. All scripts load only for certain sites that match the URL address.

* *Click on a button and only then receive benefits* - our philosophy. No pre-fetches, pre-loads, or background processing. The plugin won't annoy you while visiting the portal.

* *Open source and small codebase* - easy to read, easy to debug, easy to understand
